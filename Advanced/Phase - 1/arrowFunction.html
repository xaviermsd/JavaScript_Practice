        // The concept of arrows was first introduced in
        //CoffeeScript and since then, the javascript
        //developers who had worked with CoffeScript wanted
        //the same concept in JavaScript. And finally,
        //arrows were introduced in ES6.
        //Arrow functions simply reduced the number of lines in a program.
        //Normal Function
        let myFun = function() {
            console.log("Function is working");
        };
        myFun();

        //ArrowFunction
        let myFun2 = () => {
            console.log("Function is working too");
        };
        myFun2();

        //Another Example
        //Normal
        const sum = function(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        };
        //Arrow
        console.log(sum(1, 2));
        const sum2 = (a, b) => a + b;
        console.log(sum2(1, 3));
